# Email-to-Picasa

A simple app that allows an authenticated user to create an email address 
and map it to a picasa album.  From then on, all pictures sent to that email 
address are uploaded to the specified album.

This app is currently hosted at: http://email-to-picasa.appspot.com

Yes, picasa has this feature built in, but it doesn't allow the user to 
specify an album without having control of the email's subject line.

I use this application to archive all images sent to a mailing list.
It's delightful!  (Okay, it's useful, but maybe not delightful)
